- [x] Updated SimpleMealBuilder, AddFoodModal, useMealManagement, dataService
- [x] Test app functionality ‚úÖ (Server running without errors)
- **Actual Impact**: Production-safe logging, no data exposure in production builds

#### 3. Implement Basic Test Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY) 
- [ ] Add vitest and testing-library dependencies
- [ ] Configure test environment
- [ ] Add tests for critical components:

#### 4. Improve Type Safety (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Replace `any` types in dataService.ts with proper interfaces
- [ ] Add proper typing for child profiles, preferences, recipes
- [ ] Remove generic `any` usage across components
- [ ] **Expected Impact**: Better IDE support, fewer runtime errors

#### 5. Performance Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add React.memo to expensive components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large food lists
- [ ] Lazy load modal components
- [ ] **Expected Impact**: Faster rendering, better UX

## Low Priority Tasks  

#### 6. Security Enhancements (LOW PRIORITY)

- [ ] Implement input sanitization
- [ ] Add CSP headers
- [ ] **Expected Impact**: Better security posture

#### 7. Documentation (LOW PRIORITY)

## Commit Strategy
Each completed task will be committed with:
- Clear commit message describing what was done
- Before/after testing verification
- Impact measurement where applicable

## Notes
- Test the app thoroughly after each change
- Keep the dev server running to catch issues immediately  
- Verify all functionality works before committing
